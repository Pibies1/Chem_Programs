CHEMISTRY PROGRAMS REFERENCE GUIDE

Getting Started

1) unzip the file
- Extract all chemistry program files to your computer

2) open the ti cx cas student software
- Launch TI-Nspire CX CAS Student Software on your computer

3) connect calculator
- Connect your TI-Nspire CX CAS calculator to your computer via USB

4) drag "chem_constants.tns" FIRST
- Transfer "chem_constants.tns" to your calculator first
- This file is required by all other programs

5) drag the rest of the files in
- Transfer all other chemistry program files to your calculator
- Programs should work immediately after transfer

6) if programs don't auto-start
- Type main() and press Enter to start the program
- This should not be the case though - programs are designed to auto-start

Formatting Notes

1) how to type equations
- Use proper chemical notation: 2H + O = H2O
- Include coefficients when needed: 2H2 + O2 = 2H2O
- Use arrow notation: H2 + O2 → H2O
- Examples: Ca(OH)2, Al2(SO4)3, Mg(NO3)2

2) case sensitive
- Element symbols are case sensitive
- Use correct capitalization: H, He, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne
- Examples: H2O (correct), h2o (incorrect)

3) program exit
- Programs must be exited in the menu before going to calculator home
- Use "0: Exit" option in each program menu
- Do not force close programs

Important Notes

1) equation balancing complexity
- "chem_balance.tns" works best with simple to moderate equations
- Very complex redox equations may not balance automatically
- Manual balancing may be required for advanced problems

2) formula database limitations
- "chem_compounds.tns" contains about 50 of the most common compounds
- Not all formula names are included due to storage limitations
- Database focuses on frequently used compounds in chemistry courses

3) calculator memory
- Programs use significant calculator memory
- Close other programs when using chemistry programs
- Restart calculator if programs run slowly

4) gas law units
- Always check units when using "chem_gases.tns"
- Pressure: atm, kPa, mmHg (program will guide you)
- Temperature: must be in Kelvin for calculations
- Volume: liters (L) for most calculations

5) pH calculations
- "chem_solutions.tns" assumes standard conditions
- Very dilute or concentrated solutions may need manual calculation
- Buffer solutions work best with Henderson-Hasselbalch equation

6) program errors and limitations
- Programs may have errors and are to be used as a tool to help
- Due to amount of features, some may have limitations or be broken at this moment
- Always verify results with manual calculations
- Report issues if you find them
